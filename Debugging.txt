1] int overflow (always use ll for sum variable).
2] for loop boundary conditions
3] ; after for loop
4] changing value of variable and then using the changed value
	eg : cin >> a >> b;
	a -= min(a,b);  //value of a is changed here
	b -= min(a,b);
5] Applying binary search  OR lower/upper bound on unsorted array.
6]
