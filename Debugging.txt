1] int overflow (always use ll for sum variable).
2] for loop boundary conditions
3] ; after for loop
4] changing value of variable and then using the changed value
	eg : cin >> a >> b;
	a -= min(a,b);  //value of a is changed here
	b -= min(a,b);
5] Applying binary search  OR lower/upper bound on unsorted array.
6] while using MOD functions, check if arguments itself are <= MOD
7] Be carefull while checking bits : use (1LL << i) instead of (1<<i)
8] In graph questions if you are using 0 indexing for nodes! Take Care.
9] for ll integers use __builtin_popcountll()
10] Remember : ceil() and floor() take 'double' argument.
